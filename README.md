## Modules

This project consists of the following modules:

### Search

The search module is responsible for providing a real-time search experience to the users. It utilizes the `Turbo_Frames` feature linked with `Stimulus Js` to manage the realtime page load. Users can enter search terms and instantly see the results without refreshing the page.

### Analytics

The analytics module provides insightful analytics on the most frequently searched terms. It tracks and analyzes user search behavior to identify popular search terms and trends. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions and improve the search functionality of the application.

### 🔭 The Pyramid Problem

```bash
    In the ArticlesController, the implemented solution focuses on efficient search handling and analytics tracking.
    Here's a concise overview:

    User Session Handling:
    Retrieve or create a user session based on the session ID to track user-specific information.

    Search Query Processing:
    Sanitize and perform a search in the Article model based on the query.

    Determining if the Search Should be Saved:
    Check criteria before saving a search, including query length, difference from the last search, and elapsed time.

    Saving Search After Delay:
    Update session attributes and use a delayed thread to save the search, accommodating users who are still typing.

    Analytics Tracking:
    Create or update Analytic records for words longer than 2 characters to track their occurrence.

    This solution ensures efficient handling of searches, prevents redundant saves, and tracks word occurrences for analytics.
